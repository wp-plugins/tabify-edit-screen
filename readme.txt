Enable tabs in the edit screen and manage them from the back-end.

== Description ==

When you've got lots of post meta-boxes, your post edit screen can become difficult to search. Make your post edit screen easier to navigate and manage by creating a set of tabs, with the Tabify Edit Screen plugin. And manage it all from the WordPress back-end!

The plugin is still in active development, and I'm always looking for ways to improve it. 

Known issue: currently the plugin ignores the "show on screen" values from the Screen options. I'm currently working to fix this issue.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `tabify-edit-screen` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the Settings -> Tabify edit screen to enable tabs for a specific post type

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you define metaboxes that will always be visible? =

At this moment the title and submit box are always visible. You can change this by using the following filters:
 * tabify_default_metaboxes - $defaults, $post_type
 * tabify_default_metaboxes_$post_type - $defaults
