Enables tabs in the edit screen and manage them from the back-end

== Description ==

You ever came in a situation where the edit screen of a post type get to full that you sometimes had to search the right metabox?
This plugin enables tabs in the edit screen and manage them from the back-end.

It's still in development. In general the plugin does the things it should do but there still are a lot of things that can be improved.
Also at this moment it ignores the "Show on screen" values from the Screen options. What can be a big thing for some users

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `tabify-edit-screen` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the Settings -> Tabify edit screen to enable tabs for a specific post type
